# Scam Hunter Token ü§ñ

## Onchain `Basescan Verification Check` for blockchain addresses via `Chainlink Functions`

The Scam Hunter Token's primary goal is to provide a fully decentralized mechanism to ensure that before interacting with any contract, it checks if the contract is verified on Basescan. This check is conducted using an Onchain BasescanCheck.

The OnChain BasescanCheck involves verifying blockchain addresses using Chainlink Functions. Chainlink Functions can be used to request data from off-chain sources like Basescan (the block explorer for Base), which can then return verification status for a particular blockchain address. This check ensures that interactions with your smart contract are only allowed if the blockchain address meets specific verification criteria, like being verified on Basescan.

Scam Hunter Token uses OnChainAi and Fleek extensions by Kredeum on Scaffold-Eth-2

## Demo üëÄ

A running demo of `Scam Hunter Token`  is available on IPFS here:

- [https://many-jelly-incalculable.on-fleek.app/onchain-ai/]
(https://many-jelly-incalculable.on-fleek.app/onchain-ai/)

## Description üìó

- `Scam Hunter Token` is a Scaffold-eth-2 granted project, allowing you to interact only with verified contracts on Basescan using `BasescanCheck`. 

- `BasescanCheck` is an on-chain solution for identifying non-verified contracts, which often contain malicious code, as many scam platforms are not verified.

- `Onchain BasescanCheck` uses [`Basescan API`](https://docs.basescan.org/) with [`Chainlink Functions`](https://functions.chain.link/).

Each `BasescanCheck` request launched by `Scam Hunter Token` is sent by multiple `Chainlink` servers that have to reach consensus to return a unique answer. 

`Chainlink` answer can be retrieved only after a few blocks, and may take more than one minute, depending on the network.

- `Chainlink` requires some `LINK` tokens. 
Default model will be a fixed price of `0.0002 eth` per request.

BUT this will be changed in the future to a more dynamic pricing model.

- You can use `BasescanCheck` as it is, with the contracts already deployed, or you can deploy your own, where you will be able to set your own configuration, and decide on the price of check requests.

- `BasescanCheck` is available with a `Hardhat` setup with 3 specific tasks to help you start with the protocol.

## Install üõ†Ô∏è

<!-- Install via this command:
```sh
$ npx create-eth@latest -e kredeum/onchain-ai-extension
```

Then run the following commands to initialize the new repo,
```sh
$ cd <your new repo>
$ ./init.sh
``` -->

Finally the classic Scaffold-eth-2 commands in 3 different terminals:
```sh
$ yarn chain
```
```sh
$ yarn deploy
```
```sh
$ yarn start
```

In all these commands use `hardhat` option `--network <NETWORK>` to specify the network you want to use.

Note that `BasescanCheck` will not work on `hardhat` network (no `Chainlink` there...), so rather use a tesnet like `baseSepolia` (avoid `Sepolia` that is slower).

## Usage üí°

You can send your prompt to `BasescanCheck.sol` in different ways:
1. using `debug` page of `Scaffold-eth-2` (`out of the box`)
2. using `BasescanCheck UI` via the menu link in `Scaffold-eth-2`
3. using `ScamHunterToken UI` via the menu link in `Scaffold-eth-2` 
4. using `hardhat ai request` task
5. via your smartcontracts interacting with `BasescanCheck.sol` as does `ScamHunterToken.sol`


## Hardhat tasks üöÄ

You can run hardhat AI task with `yarn hardhat --network <NETWORK> ai <TASK>`

3 tasks available, 1 for the users: `request`, 2 for the `BasescanCheck` admin : `secrets`, `config`

```txt
AVAILABLE TASKS:

  config 	Display [and update] BasescanCheck config
  request	Read last BasescanCheck response [and send BasescanCheck request]
  secrets	Upload BasescanCheck secrets to Chainlink

ai: BasescanCheck with Chainlink and Basescan
```

### `request` task ‚ùì
**Main task**, to be used to send your prompt

Ex: `yarn hardhat --network baseSepolia ai request --prompt "13 time 5 equal ?"`

```txt
Usage: hardhat [GLOBAL OPTIONS] ai request [--prompt <STRING>]

OPTIONS:

  --prompt	BasescanCheck prompt request for Chainlink

request: Read last BasescanCheck response [and send BasescanCheck request]
```


### `secrets` task üîí
Admin task, to be used to upload your secrets to Chainlink

Ex: `yarn hardhat --network baseSepolia ai secrets --expiration 10`

```txt
Usage: hardhat [GLOBAL OPTIONS] ai secrets [--expiration <INT>]

OPTIONS:

  --expiration	Expiration time in minutes of uploaded secrets  (default: 60)

secrets: Upload BasescanCheck secrets to Chainlink
```

### `config` task ‚öôÔ∏è
Admin task, to manage BasescanCheck configuration

Ex: `yarn hardhat --network baseSepolia ai config --price 0.0002`

```txt
Usage: hardhat [GLOBAL OPTIONS] ai config [--chainname <STRING>] [--donid <INT>] [--explorer <STRING>] [--router <STRING>] [--rpc <STRING>] [--subid <INT>]

OPTIONS:

  --chainname	Chain name
  --donid    	Chainlink DON Id
  --explorer 	Chain explorer url
  --router   	Chainlink routeur address
  --rpc      	Base Rpc url
  --subid    	Chainlink Subscription Id

config: Display [and update] OnChainAI config
```

Any updated value, will be written to the config file, and store onchain for `donid`and `subid`

Router address must be set **before** deployment of a new version of `OnChainAI` contract.

Config file can be found at [packages/hardhat/chainlink/config.json](chainlink/config.json)

### Shortcut ‚è©
You can define a shortcut in your package.json like that :
```json
"scripts": {
  "ai": "hardhat --network baseSepolia ai"
}
```
then call it with `yarn ai <TASK> <OPTIONS>`

## OpenAI üß†

A specific `system prompt` is used for each OpenAI request, you can view it inside the javascript code run by `Chainlink DON` : [packages/hardhat/chainlink/source/verificationCheck.js](chainlink/source/verificationCheck.js)


## Security üõ°Ô∏è
In order to never store your secrets and private keys in plain text on your hard disk (["hi @PatrickAlphaC"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIbhqRJ4B8I)), this extension use `Chainlink env-enc` module to encrypt your secrets before storing them.

In order to setup `env-enc`, in hardhat directory first define a password with `yarn env-enc set-pw` then input your secrets with `yarn env-enc set`

If you want to keep original unsecure `dotenv` stuff just comment 2 `env-enc` lines, and uncomment the 2 `dotenv` lines at the begining of `hardhat.config.ts`

Same ENV values are needed for both `dotenv` and `env-enc`:
- `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` : private key of the deployer
- `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` : alchemy api key
- `BASESCAN_API_KEY` : basescan API key

- `BASESCAN_API_KEY` : will be uploaded in a secure way to `Chainlink DON`  (don't use centralized S3 solutions also proposed by `Chainlink`)

## Limitations üöß

- `Chainlink Functions` is currently in `beta` so as `BasescanCheck` and `ScamHunterToken` is.

- `BasescanCheck` prompt must be and only can be a blockchain adress of a smart contract.

- `BasescanCheck` answer must very short, in order for `Chainlink Functions` to be able to reach a consensus on an answer.


## Roadmap  ‚û°Ô∏è
- deploy on Mainnet: requires some tuning on requested price, using some `Chainlink Oracle Price feed`
- implement other networks: `optimismSepolia`, `arbitrumSepolia` etc.
- deploy `BasescanCheck` on all networks supported by `Chainlink Functions` (curently as of August 2024 : Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche)
- deploy with same address on all networks
- setup an foundry extension too
